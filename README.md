# NestJS Video Stream

I wanted to try out streaming video, so I put this together.

I have not committed the file to be streamed as it's not right to force someone to sync an 81mb file. The file referenced is Spring by the Blender Open Movie project. Download from the link below and place in the `src/assets` folder, or use your own and update the `path` used in the root route.

Based on these examples:
